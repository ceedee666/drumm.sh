# drumm.sh

This repo contains the my personal website. I use it mainly to distribute
information about my leactues at the FH Aachen and for my personal blog.

The website is build using Gatsby.js. Most of the content is managed as
Markdown files.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Start developing**

   Make sure to setup your Gatsby.js dev environment e.g. using [this
   guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-zero/). Fork the repo and
   start it up.

   `sh cd drumm.sh/ gatsby develop`

2. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This
   is a tool you can use to experiment with querying this website's data. Learn
   more about using this tool in the [Gatsby
   tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

3. **Give Feedback**
