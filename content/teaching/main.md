[This site](/teaching/previous_lectures) contains a list of lectures I taught
during the previous terms.

# Bachelor and Master Thesis

If you would like me to be the supervisor of your thesis please write an email.
I'll then schedule a first meeting where we discuss the requirements and expectations.

A [list of possible thesis topics](/teaching/thesis) as well as a selection of
the thesis I supervised in past is available [here](/teaching/thesis).

# Student Blog

The [Student's Blog](/student-blog/) contains blog posts written by students as
part of my lectures at [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de).
