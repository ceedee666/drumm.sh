During the summer term 2023 I teach the following lectures at [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de):

- [Digital Lab](/teaching/lectures/2023/summer_term/digital_lab)
- [Industrielle Produktion](/teaching/lectures/2023/summer_term/industrielle_produktion)
- [Informationssysteme](/teaching/lectures/2023/summer_term/informationssysteme)
- [SAP in der Praxis](/teaching/lectures/2023/summer_term/sap_in_der_praxis)

Additionally, I co-organize a virtual lecture series on information systems:

- [Virtuelle Vorlesungsreihe WI (#vivowi)](/teaching/lectures/2023/summer_term/vivowi)

[This site](/teaching/lectures/previous_lectures) contains a list of lectures I taught
during the previous terms.

## Learning Agreement 🤝

All my lectures are based on this [learning agreement](/teaching/learning_agreement).

## Bachelor and Master Thesis 🎓

If you would like me to be the supervisor of your thesis please write an email.
I'll then schedule a first meeting where we discuss the requirements and expectations.

A [list of possible thesis topics](/teaching/thesis) as well as a selection of
thesis I supervised in past is available [here](/teaching/thesis).

## Student Blog

The [Student's Blog](/student-blog/) contains blog posts written by students as
part of my lectures at [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de).
