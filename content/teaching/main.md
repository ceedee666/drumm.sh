## Learning Agreement 🤝

All my lectures are based on this [learning agreement](/teaching/learning_agreement).

## Bachelor and Master Thesis 🎓

If you would like me to be the supervisor of your thesis please write an email.
I'll then schedule a first meeting where we discuss the requirements and expectations.

A [list of possible thesis topics](/teaching/thesis) as well as a selection of
thesis I supervised in past is available [here](/teaching/thesis).
