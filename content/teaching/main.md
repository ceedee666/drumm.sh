## General Guidelines §

🛠️](/teaching/rules-for-tools) specify which tools are permitted in my courses.

## Bachelor’s and Master’s Theses 🎓

If you’re interested in having me as your thesis supervisor, please send me an
email. We will then arrange an initial meeting to discuss requirements and
expectations.
