## General Guidelines §

All my lectures follow the principles outlined in this [learning agreement
🤝](/teaching/learning-agreement). Additionally, the [rules for tools
🛠️](/teaching/rules-for-tools) specify which tools are permitted in my courses.

## Bachelor’s and Master’s Theses 🎓

If you’re interested in having me as your thesis supervisor, please send me an
email. We will then arrange an initial meeting to discuss requirements and
expectations.

A [list of available thesis topics](/teaching/thesis) and an archive of
previously supervised theses can be found [here](/teaching/thesis).
