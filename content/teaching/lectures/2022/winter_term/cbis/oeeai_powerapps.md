## OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)

Oee.ai is a manufacturing intelligence platform founded by Prof.Dr.Markus Focke from
FH Aachen University and his partner Jörn Steinbeck.Oee is made up of three factors:
availability, performance and quality. The goal of oee.ai is to provide real data
about production processes in order to optimise the production process. Oee.ai helps
you to determine the productivity of your manufacturing in real time, to identify
production potentials and motivate your employees for the optimisation. Using the
oee.ai you can get as much as possible out of your investments together with your
team. The production optimisation is complex, the environment is dynamic and the
technology develops fast.

## Power Apps

Power Apps is a platform as a service that enables you to create applications that
run on any mobile device or browser.
The purpose behind developing Power Apps is to make users build applications with
new capabilities without having coding expertise. Power Apps has connections with
various Microsoft-based and third- party applications, including Share Point, SQL
server, One Drive in the Office 365 productivity.......
What sets Power Apps apart from other offerings is both developers and non-technical
teams can use it. The Power Apps advantages are:

1. Easy integration with other Microsoft services
1. User-friendly interface
1. Canvas Apps and Model-driven Apps
1. Cloud connectivity
1. App creation and Sharing
1. Cost-effective
1. Common Data Service (CDS)

You can store and manage data securely.

## Power Platform

The Microsoft Power Platform is a group of products offered by Microsoft to develop
and build complex business solutions, analyze and draw data visualizations, automate
a business process or build virtual agents for communication. All these products
offer a platform in which no code is required to build the applications.

With its no-code/low code approach, Microsoft Power Platform makes it significantly
easier to generate valuable insights from data, deploy rich applications, create
powerful workflows, automation and leverage Al. These capabilities are intuitive
and achievable through a simple drag – and drop.

## oee.ai and Power Apps

Use oee.ai Power Apps to improve customer experience
Power Apps: companies receive complete control over their manufacturing processes. With the Power Apps,
companies can use the data they receive about their production processes to create
customised applications and user- friendfly dashboards. With this platform, they can track
the productivity and efficiency of their manufacturing in real time. By accessing
detailed data, companies can gain insight into every aspect of manufacturing and
improve decision making. Power Apps enable companies to identify and fix problems
immediately using powerful
tools such as machine recognition or machine learning. The platform also enables
them to generate optimisation suggestions for their production and fully exploit
the potential of the production process. By connecting the oee.ai with Power Apps,
companies can derive both insights from the analyses process and also actions to
maximise the value of production.The solution gives companies more flexibility and
complete control over
all aspects of manufacturing. Companies can improve
the performance of their manufacturing and achieve
cost savings at the same time by using resources more efficiently. With Power Apps,
companies can use the
full potential of their production while identifying and solving problems faster. Integrationh with oee.ai enables companies to capture, analyse and optimise data about their production processes.

## Why can Power Apps help to improve the customer experience ?

Advantages of combining oee.ai and Power Apps.The combination of oee.ai and Power Apps offers companies
a multitude of advantages. By integrating real-time data
into user-friendly dashboards, companies can more easily
react to potential problems in their manufacturing processes
and more efficiently point out possible optimisation
opportunities. The visualisation of data helps companies
to analyse the productivity and efficiency of their plants in
order to continuously improve processes. In addition, the
costs for manual data entry are significantly reduced as all
data are automatically captured via oee.ai . This enables
companies to increase machine utilisation and optimise
production at the same time. Thanks to real-time analytics using oee.ai and Power
Apps, companies have a tool at hand now to make their production processes even more
efficient and thus drive their business forward.

## Conclusion: Why invest in oee.ai. Power Apps to improve the customer experience?

The data from oee.ai can also be integrated in Power Apps. To do this, the app only
needs to be linked with the API-key of the oee.ai app. Then the data can be inserted
into the Power App in the form of tables or graphics. Combining the data from oee.ai
with other data sources allows us to gain new perspectives on our work processes
and better understand future challenges.
