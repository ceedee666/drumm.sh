# Python for Beginners

## Week 2 Unit 4: Exercise

You are given the following list containing stock symbols, their current price as well as the absolute price change of the previous day:

```Py
stocks = [["SAP", 106, -3.0], ["AAPL", 165, 1.25], ["TSLA", 860, 54.2], ["ORCL", 76, -0.25], ["ZM", 114, 6.2]]
```

<br>

As you plan to take some of the profits, write a program that creates a list of all the stock symbols with a change of more than +5 percent. The list should be named sell_list. The list should only contain the stock symbol, not the price or the absolute change. Print the resulting list.
