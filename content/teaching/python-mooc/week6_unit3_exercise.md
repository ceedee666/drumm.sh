# Python for Beginners

## Week 6 Unit 3: Exercise

Import the ```random``` library and have a look at the function ```gauss()``` which gives back a random float number. Which parameters are required? Write a function ```gaussian_distribution()``` that returns a list of 1000 random numbers with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. Invoke this function.

For the resulting list calculate and print the mean and the standard deviation using the respective functions from the ```statistics``` library. Re-run the program and observe, if the values change.

Below is the output of an example execution of the program. Note that the values of the standard derivation and the mean might be different in your case.

```Py
Mean: 100.15215154056546
Standard Deviation: 9.93532937167394
```
