The file [numbers.txt](files/numbers.txt) contains random integer numbers.
There is exactly one number per line. Read the file and output the three
biggest numbers in the following form:

```zsh
2345
223
89
```

### Hint

Read the file line by line, delete the line break. As files can only contain strings,
the number must now be converted into an integer. Add the number into a list.
When all numbers are in the list, sort the list. Then print out the biggest
numbers.
