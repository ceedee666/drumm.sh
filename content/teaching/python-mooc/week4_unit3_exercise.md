# Python for Beginners

## Week 4 Unit 3: Exercise

The file [numbers.txt](numbers.txt) contains random integer numbers. There is exactly one number per line. Read the file and output the three biggest numbers in the following form:

```Py
2345
223
89
```

### Hint

Read the file line by line, delete the line break. As files can only contain strings, the number must now be converted into an integer. Add the number into a list. When all numbers are in the list, sort the list. Then print out the biggest numbers.
