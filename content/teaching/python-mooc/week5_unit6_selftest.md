### Question 1

#### In Python, integer numbers are objects. Therefore, there are methods defined on integer objects. The method ```.bit_length()``` returns the number of bits required to represent an integer. Using the function ```bin()``` you can get the binary representation of an integer. For example, ```bin(28)``` returns ```0b11100```. The digits behind the letter b are the digital representation for the integer 28. There are 5 digits required for this representation, so the method ```.bit_length``` would return the value 5. What is the output of the following program?
