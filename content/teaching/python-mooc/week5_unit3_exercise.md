# Python for Beginners

## Week 5 Unit 3: Exercise

Implement the function ```is_even(number)``` which gets an integer as input parameter and checks, if this input is even or not. ```is_even()``` will return the boolean value ```True``` if the value is even and ```False``` if the input is not even.

Implement a ```for``` loop which iterates over the ```range(100)```. Within the ```for``` loop, the sequence-variable is checked with the function ```is_even()```. Depending on the return value, either ```x is even``` or ```x is not even``` is printed.

Example output:

```Py
0 is even
1 is not even
2 is even
...
```
