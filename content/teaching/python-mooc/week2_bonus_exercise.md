Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is dividable by 3 print Fizz, if the number is dividable by 5 print Buzz instead of the number. If the number is dividable by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz.

Below is the output of the program for the first 15 numbers:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
