<details>
	<summary>If you have data about students and each data set for a student is structured in the same way (e.g. name, firstname, e-mail), then a list of tuples can be used to handle this data.</summary>

<details>
	<summary>The data type for complex data should be carefully chosen, as this decision has an impact on the implementation of the program.</summary>
