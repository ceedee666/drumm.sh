### Question 5

*Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.*

<br>

<details>
	<summary>The function "len()" can be used for lists, tuples, and dictionaries.</summary>

	<img  src="selftest/cross.png" width="25">
</details>


<details>
	<summary>The variable "a" is undefined, because the program executes the else-part of the if-statement and the assignment of "a" is not executed (if there has been a value assigned to "a" before, this value is unchanged).</summary>
	<img  src="selftest/check.png" width="25">
</details>

<br>

### Question 9

#### Which of the following statements about functions and methods for complex data types are correct?

*Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.*

<br>

<details>
	<summary>The method ".insert(i, x)" can only be used for lists and tuples but not for dictionaries, because an index is required.</summary>
	<img  src="selftest/cross.png" width="25">
</details>


<details>
	<summary>The method ".sort()" cannot be used for tuples, because tuples are immutable.</summary>
	<img  src="selftest/check.png" width="25">
</details>


<details>
	<summary>The function "sorted()" can be used for tuples, as the original tuple is unchanged. The function creates a new list.</summary>

</details>


<details>
	<summary>If the method .keys() is used for lists, a list of all indices is given back.</summary>
