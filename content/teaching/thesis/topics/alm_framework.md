PowerApps is currently the only component of the PowerPlatform that natively supports
versioning. For more advanced users, solutions are used to aid the ALM process. However,
solutions can quickly become crowded when multiple versions of a flow are being saved.
Furthermore, collaboration can be challenging to realize. Past improvements to PowerPlatform
infrastructure have often been achieved through the import of solutions that provide
additional functionality through easy (model-driven) PowerApps interfaces. The goal
is to develop a concept for an easy-to-use Solution Management Tool that comes with
a business user-friendly UI while making collaboration and versioning on projects possible
through the Microsoft Solution Management API.

The thesis is conducted in cooperation with [jovoco](https://www.jovoco.io/).
