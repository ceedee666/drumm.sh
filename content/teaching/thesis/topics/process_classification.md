Germany's public sector is often deemed impossible to digitize, with the most common
obstacle being data privacy. However, upon deeper examination of organization and daily
tasks in local government entities, it becomes apparent that only a fraction of the
daily work involves sensitive personal and government data. Instead, the larger part
of the daily tasks is related to the administration of the local government's resources
to "run the town." These processes are similar to the processes in small- and mid-
sized firms and should be a prime opportunity for digitalization through the Power
Platform without compromising the personal data of citizens.

The thesis is conducted in cooperation with [jovoco](https://www.jovoco.io/).
