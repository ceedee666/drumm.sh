Since the inception of Neo-Banks, the banking space, and its related services (tax
and accounting) have increasingly adopted a more open concept that allows connecting
to data through APIs. An assessment should be made on how "ready" (standardized, widely
available) the banking space and its related services are for PowerPlatform integration.
Furthermore, an analysis should be conducted to determine which business processes
would benefit from such an integration (Accounting, Budgeting, HR...).

The thesis is conducted in cooperation with [jovoco](https://www.jovoco.io/).
