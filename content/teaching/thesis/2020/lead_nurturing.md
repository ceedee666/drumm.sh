## Abstract

The objective of this thesis is to find out whether the pure amount of
implemented influencing factors impact the success of lead nurturing campaigns.
Lead nurturing campaigns are understood at Like Reply as campaigns that are
about the care and provision of information to leads to help them achieve their
objectives [1]. Like Reply creates a digital experience by combining effective
solution design with innovative marketing and e-commerce cloud technology.
Only a few Like Reply customers are currently conducting lead nurturing
in any form. Therefore, Like Reply wants to offer its customers the possibility
to learn central elements of modern marketing and apply them to their company.
A challenge is that in the available literature the influencing factors are
only discussed and presented separately, i.e. they are not presented in
dependence with other influencing factors. This research was selected
to support Like Reply in managing lead nurturing campaigns and to reduce the
gap in scientific research.

For the analysis, the first step is to work out the influencing factors:
Principles, features, and functionalities. The work of DAVID LEWIS is used as
the primary source for the elaboration. DAVID LEWIS presents five principles
that influence the success of lead nurturing. These principles are divided
into so-called features, necessary for successful implementation of the
principles. Subsequently, the features are again subdivided into
functionalities which are crucial for the success of lead nurturing
campaigns which can be considered professional, modern marketing lead
nurturing campaign. The development of features and functionalities is
based on the tasks performed by Like Reply.

In a next step four lead nurturing campaigns are introduced. After the
influencing factors, as well as the lead nurturing campaigns, have been
presented, the analysis is carried out. The lead nurturing campaigns are
examined for the presence of specific functionalities. The implementation of
the functionalities affects the occurrence of the features, which in
turn affects the principles.
The analysis shows that the amount of implemented features and
functionalities impact the success of lead nurturing campaigns.
However, the analysis could not determine whether the amount of
principles impacts the success of lead nurturing campaigns.
