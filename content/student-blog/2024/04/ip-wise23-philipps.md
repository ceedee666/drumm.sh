## A short backstory

Grievy is an app that serves as a digital companion after the loss of a loved one.
It was developed through a collaboration between Nele Stadtbäumer, who came up with
the idea, Professor Drumm, who facilitated the project, and a team of six students
from Fachhochschule Aachen, who turned Nele’s ideas into a software product.
The idea had such momentum, that Nele and two of the students founded a startup
and refined their idea and product. Some features, including support with
bureaucratic tasks, had to be dropped in this refinement process.
Now, two years after the launch of
grievy, the startup has decided to work together with FH Aachen again, to
realize these organizational features in a sister app for grievy. Grievt
gives users handy advice surrounding funerals
and other topics, an editable checklist of things that need to be done after
the death of a loved one, and a feature for automatically generating letters of
termination for different contracts.

## Forming – Storming – Norming…

Within Scrum, you need a product owner, a scrum master and a development team. Daniel
Bachmann, one of the students who worked on grievy and went on as cofounder of the
startup, now took the role of product owner, and Professor Drumm took the role of Scrum
Master. For the development team, six students from FH Aachen were chosen, but after
the first two weeks of the semester, only four of us remained. This worried us in the
beginning, but with time we came to appreciate working in a small team. While many
things were new for us, we benefitted from the fact that Daniel and Professor Drumm
had not only worked on this kind of project before but also worked together before.

In any kind of group work, there needs to be time spent storming and norming between
group members, before the stage of performing is entered. In the end, the size of our
team and the previous experience of Daniel and Professor Drumm helped us become productive
quite fast.

## What we learned

Working on grievt provided invaluable learning opportunities. We gained experience
using Typescript and the Ionic framework, Github, SAST tools and developing and testing
for the Apple appstore and Google playstore, and most importantly working with Scrum.

In the second half
of the semester, Herr Drumm started tracking our accuracy and velocity, teaching us
about the usual trajectory of these measures and emphasizing the importance of correct
evaluation and the advantage of well-written user stories. There were times when we
believed we would finish a particular user story within a sprint, but some details
kept us pulling our hair. Within the last two weeks of the project, a lot of bug fixing
occurred and last-minute amendments were made. Suddenly, issues that took us hours
only a month ago were solved in a fraction of that time. We had gotten to know the
technology and our app so much better that we could come up with solutions quicker
and more creatively.

## The App

At the end of January, we showed the final result of our app to our peers in a live
presentation. It was exciting to take a step back and see the full picture of what
we worked on closely all semester. While app store deployment still awaited review
at this time, grievt became available to the general public two weeks later. This
marked the success and endpoint of our project. Today, when I navigate to
grievt in the app store, it notifies me of the fact that I am an internal tester,
a sweet reminder of the work I put into the app.
