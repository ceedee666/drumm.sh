# Research Projects

### WiLMo - Wirtschaftsinformatik Lehr- und Lern-Module

The aim of the WiLMo project is to create uniform digital teaching and learning material for business information system courses or
business information systems majors at universities. This teaching material should
initially be used at the universities in North Rhine-Westphalia involved
in this project and later be used nationwide. On the basis of a consistent didactic
concept, students are provided with learning materials that have a very high didactic
quality, are coordinated across universities and are freely accessible. This promotes
vocational learning that is independent of face-to-face teaching.

### LuCID

The project **LuCID - Die Lernumgebung f√ºrs Programmieren basierend auf 4C-ID**
has been funded by the [Stifterverband](https://www.stifterverband.org/) in the context of a senior fellowship
for innovations in digital teaching in higher education. Further information regarding
this project are available [here](https://www.stifterverband.org/digital-lehrfellows-nrw/2019/drumm).

One preliminary result of the project is a repository with teaching material and
self learning exercises for an introductory python lecture. The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ceedee666/python_introduction).
